## Experience and Professional Accomplishments:

### Senior Analyst I Data Science, DXC Technology, New Orleans, LA	February 2019 - Present

- Developed and deployed containers using Docker Compose yaml scripts that coordinated Airflow, Kafka, and a Java application to create pdf documents for archiving
- Developed DAGs in Airflow to process Oracle database data into xml documents
- Created templates with Jinja and wrote the scripts to generate pdfâ€™s from xml documents 
- Used prompt engineering with Github Copilot to convert IBM Datastage jobs to Databricks and PySpark
- Engineered prompts to in Github Copilot to create unit tests based on code changes in git repos
- Architected GCP MLOps services for the implementation of ML for a major aerospace firm
- Created ML models in BigQuery and deployed those models to endpoints for real-time prediction
- Created heuristics in BigQuery to challenge/test models developed by another ML team in India
- Wrote code using Pandas and PyArrow to develop an ETL pipeline to process and analyze ServiceNow incidents and Nagios state change objects stored as Parquet files to tune a ServiceNow installation for a major aerospace firm
- Developed a seminar on using Databricks and PySpark to analyze Energy Information Agency (EIA) electricity production data
- Built data pipelines in Python to scrape EIA electricity production data and SEC log files into cloud storage
- Implemented and modified Terraform scripts and deploy in Jenkins to automate Cloud deployments (AWS)
- Wrote and refactored SQL and Bash shell scripts to transition a client from Impala on Cloudera to Hive on AWS EMR
- Performed EDA using Pandas, develop a pilot model using a Ridge Classifier from Scikit-Learn, and reporting in PowerBI to determine the root cause of patching failures in Windows 10 for a major client
- Designed a metric for analyzing the technical viability (based on technical debt as measured by software end of life) and value (based on cost per server) of updating and migrating top 200 clients to cloud and other services
- Worked with a team tasked with data mining DXC's top 200 accounts
- Developed a logistic regression model that analyzed Service Now failures based on "Status Requests" within Service Now that self-identified repeat inquiries and call-backs
- Designed the database backend in Azure SQL for a PowerBI dashboard to aid in the reporting of ServiceNow data monthly
- Developed the code in R to extract the location data used to report on the geographic concentration of ServiceNow incidents
- Developed a logistic regression model using R to predict the probability that a sales opportunity converts to revenue  
- Developed a model of the distribution of job positions based on historical win data that, combined with the probability model, predict the total number of positions expected in the coming quarters
- As part of DXC Technology's Industrialized Artificial Intelligence (AI) Bootcamp, developed code using the Tidyverse, data.table, and sf packages to encode 28,090 property addresses and over a million Calls for Service (CFS) encoded by longitude and latitude with the number of CFS by the NOPD within 300 meters of the property location. The code parallelized the computation across 8 cores of a laptop's CPU, reducing computational time significantly

### Model Validation Analyst, Hancock Whitney Bank, New Orleans, LA	June 2017 - February 2019

- Responsible for the validating, testing, and developing benchmarks for models used by the bank-including, but not limited to: DFAST, Trust Investment, and mortgage modification models
- Saved the Trust Investments department $440k by demonstrating that the data they used in one of their predictive models was worse than random guessing, justifying the hiring of a dedicated Quantitative Analyst who subsequently improved their modeling
- Managed and maintained model issues monitoring in MetricStream
- Continued to develop and maintained skills with R/S-Plus and financial and econometric modeling
- Redesigned the reporting maintained by the Model Validation Group using R scripts and SQLite away from monolithic VBA scripts

### Assistant Professor, Nicholls State University, Thibodaux, LA	August 2011 - August 2017

- Developed and taught courses in microeconomics, macroeconomics, monetary policy and financial markets, labor economics, health care policy, public economics, and international trade
- Chaired the AACSB New Standards Committee. We were tasked with implementing the new accreditation standards handed down by the AACSB. As a committee we successfully wrote the new standards for faculty qualification and for the documentation of impact of research and service. AACSB stands for "Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business"
